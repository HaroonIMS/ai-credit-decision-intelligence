# 🏦 AI Credit Decision Intelligence System

An **industry-level, end-to-end Credit Risk Decision Intelligence System** built using real-world Lending Club data.  
This project integrates **Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Policy Simulation, and a Streamlit Web Application** to support transparent and data-driven lending decisions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern credit risk systems must do more than predict default — they must **explain decisions, simulate lending policies, and provide interactive decision interfaces**.

This project delivers:
- Credit risk prediction using machine learning
- Explainable AI for regulatory transparency
- Policy simulation for business decision-making
- A **Streamlit-based web application** for real-time interaction

---

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### ✔️ Credit Risk Prediction
- Binary classification:
  - `0` → Fully Paid (Low Risk)
  - `1` → Charged Off (High Risk)
- Supervised ML models trained on historical loan data

---

### ✔️ Time-Aware Modeling (Industry Best Practice)
- Data split based on loan issue date
- Prevents data leakage
- Reflects real-world deployment of credit risk systems

---

### ✔️ Explainable AI (XAI)
- Feature importance analysis
- Transparent and interpretable predictions
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

---

### ✔️ Decision Intelligence & Policy Simulation
- Risk threshold experimentation
- Approval / rejection policy analysis
- Impact assessment of lending strategies

---

### ✔️ Streamlit Web Application
- Interactive user interface for:
  - Uploading / selecting loan data
  - Visualizing predictions and risk categories
  - Exploring model insights and policy outcomes
- Bridges the gap between **ML models and business users**

---

## 🖥️ Streamlit Application

The Streamlit app serves as the **front-end decision layer**, allowing stakeholders to:
- Interact with the trained model
- Analyze borrower risk profiles
- Simulate approval strategies in real time

Dashboard previews are included in the repository.
